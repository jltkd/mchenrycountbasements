We want all of our clients to have       
 relevant information so they can make an intelligent 
and informed decision about who they choose for 
their remodel, so we put together a couple points to keep in 
mind.</em>          
           
           
         </p>
    <p><em>       
     
       4. Don't Just Go With the 
Low-Ball Offer<br>You usually just want to not consider the       
     
       low-ball offer.&nbsp; It 
usually translates to the contractor not being very       
 good or is desperate for work, both of 
these can translate into a less-than-favorable contractor experience.&nbsp; 
Use other factors like quality of work and experience to make your 
decision.</em>          
           
           
         </p>
    <p><em>       
     
       3. Investigate<br>Do proper 
research.&nbsp; Make calls to       
     
       previous clients to 
check how their projects went.&nbsp; Pay a visit       
 to one of their current sites, if at 
all possible.&nbsp; If you see the job site 
is clean and workers are courteous, the contractor is probably a safe 
bet.</em>          
           
           
         </p>
    <p><em>       
     
       3. Get Everything in 
Writing<br>       
     
          
Get a contract written up that details each       
 and every aspect of the project.&nbsp; Getting a 
clear contract in writing isn't an indicator you 
don't trust the contractor, it simply means you want a successful remodeling 
project.</em>          
           
           
         </p>
    <p><em>       
     
       2. Several Years of Experience 
Doesn't Equal Quality<br>There are a lot of people that get poor work from 
contractors who say they have been       
     
       in bbusiness for 
20+ years. This doesn't mean a lot because       
 they could have just done bad jobs for 
all those twenty years. Make sure to take 
into consideration other factors to decide if the contractor is a qualified 
professional.</em>
