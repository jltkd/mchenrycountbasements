Now</a></em>

    <p><em>Some of our services 
are:<br>&nbsp;Bathrooms<br>&nbsp;Kitchens<br>&nbsp;All Types of Painting and 
Finishing<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hardwood Flooring<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Windows, Doors, and Skylights<br>&nbsp;Finished Basements<br>&nbsp;Outdoor

         </p>
    <p><em>We want all of our clients to have the information 
necessary to make an informed and intelligent purchase decision, so we have made 
a list of points to take into consideration when deciding on a remodeling 
contractor.</em>          
           
           
         </p>
    <p><em>2. Do Not Make it A Do-It-Yourself Job<br>Smaller 
jobs, like painting, are ok for the homeowner to tackle, but anything larger 
than that will most likely require a qualified professional.&nbsp; Less than 20% 
of do-it-yourself jobs go well and when you do it yourself, you most likely will 
have to call a professional to fix the problem anyway.</em>          
           
           
         </p>
    <p><em>1. Check His References<br>Ask about projects the 
contractor has had in the past so you know what their quality of work is 
like.&nbsp; Make sure to get references that will be able to tell you things 
like how clean the contractor was and if they completed it within the given 
timeframe.</em>          
           
           
         </p>
    <p><em>4. Don't Automatically Go With the Low-Ball 
Offer<br>Just because a contractor has the lowest price doesn't mean he is the 
best one to go with.&nbsp; Other things to take into consideration are quality 
of work, how well he communicates and what his references say about 
him.</em>          
           
           
         </p>
    <p><em>3. Put it in Writing<br>Write up a contract that 
goes over everything about the project: schedule of payments, products and 
materials that are going to be used, estimated start and end date of the 
project, proof of insurance, etc.&nbsp; Making sure there is a clear contract 
doesn't mean you don't trust the contractor, it only means you want a successful 
renovation.</em>          
           
           
         </p>
