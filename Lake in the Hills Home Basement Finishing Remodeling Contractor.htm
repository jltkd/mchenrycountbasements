  We want our clients to have       
 all the information necessary to make an informed 
and intelligent decision, so we put together a 
short list of points to take into consideration when choosing a remodeling 
contractor.</em>          
           
           
         </p>
    <p><em>       
     
       1. Check His 
References<br>       
     
           
 Inquire about the contractor's previous       
     
       projects so you 
know what their quality of work is like.&nbsp;       
 Be sure to ask for references that will 
be able to tell you things like how 
quickly the job was completed and if the contractor was clean and 
courteous.</em>          
           
           
         </p>
    <p><em>       
     
       2. Do Not Make it A 
Do-It-Yourself Job<br>Smaller jobs,       
     
       like painting, are ok 
for the homeowner to tackle, but       
     
       anything larger than 
that will most likely require a qualified professional.&nbsp;       
 Less than 20% of do-it-yourself jobs turn out 
well and when you do it yourself, you 
most likely will have to call a professional anyway to fix the 
problem.</em>          
           
           
         </p>
    <p><em>       
     
       3. Put it in Writing<br>Write 
up a contract that goes over everything about       
     
       the project: proof of 
insurance, schedule of payments, estimated start       
     
       and end date 
of the project, products and materials that are       
 going to be used, etc.&nbsp; Insisting that there 
is a clear contract is not a sign 
of mistrust, its a sing that you want your renovation to be 
successful.</em>          
           
           
         </p>
    <p><em>       
     
       4. Don't Automatically Go With 
the Low-Ball Offer<br>       
     
           
            
     
         Just 
because a contractor has the lowest price doesn't       
 mean he is the best bet.&nbsp; Other things 
to take into consideration are quality of work, 
how well he communicates and how highly his past clients speak of 
him.</em>
