 We want all of our clients to 
have       
 relevant information so they can make an intelligent 
and informed decision about who they choose for 
their remodel, so we put together a couple points to keep in 
mind.</em>          
           
           
         </p>
    <p><em>       
 2. Many Years of Experience 
Doesn't Equal Quality<br>There are so many people that get poor work from 
contractors who claim to have been in the business or trade for 20+ years. This 
doesn't mean much       
 because they could have just done bad work 
for all those twenty years. Make sure to 
look at other factors to determine if the contractor is a qualified 
professional.</em>          
           
           
         </p>
    <p><em>       
 1. Check References<br>Take a 
look at the contractor's past projects so you have a good idea of their work       
 quality.&nbsp; Get references from them and be sure 
to ask those references pertinent questions like if 
the project was completed under budget and how clean and tidy they 
were.</em>          
           
           
         </p>
    <p><em>       
 4. Don't Immediately Take the 
Low-Ball Offer<br>This doesn't necessarily mean that the one with the low-ball 
offer is not experienced, but that       
 should only be one factor you take into 
consideration when choosing.&nbsp; If the contractor with the 
lowest offer also happens to be the most qualified, then go with 
him.</em>          
           
           
         </p>
    <p><em>       
 3. Get Everything in 
Writing<br>Get a contract written up that goes       
 over each and every detail of the project.&nbsp; 
Getting a clear contract in writing doesn't mean 
you don't trust the contractor, it just means you want a successful 
remodel.</em>
