    <p><em>We want all our clients to have every piece 
of relevant information necessary to make an intelligent and 
informed decision, so we have put together a 
list of points to take into consideration when deciding on a remodeling 
contractor.</em>          
           
           
         </p>
    <p><em>1. Check References<br> Look at the contractor's past projects 
so you have an idea of their quality of 
work.&nbsp; Ask for references and be sure to 
ask those references pertinent questions like if the project was completed under 
budget.</em>          
           
           
         </p>
    <p><em>2. Many Years of Experience 
Doesn't Equal Quality<br>I can't tell you how many people get poor work from 
contractors who claim to have been in the business or trade for five, ten or 
twenty or more years. Don't pay too much attention to years of experience, even 
if they've been in business for twenty years, they 
could have done a bad job all those 
twenty years.&nbsp; Investigate to ensure you are doing business with a qualified 
professional.</em>          
           
           
         </p>
    <p><em>3. Get Everything in 
Writing<br>Get a contract written up that goes over every detail of the project: 
schedule of payments, proof of insurance, products and materials that are going to be used, estimated start 
and end date of the project, etc.&nbsp; Having a 
clear contract doesn't mean you don't trust the 
contractor, it just means you want your remodeling project to be a 
success.</em>          
           
           
         </p>
    <p><em>4. Don't Automatically Go With 
the Low-Ball Offer<br>You usually just want to throw out the low-ball 
offer.&nbsp; It usually means that the contractor is 
not very good or desperate for work, both of 
these can translate to a not-so-good remodeling experience.&nbsp; 
Use other factors like experience and quality of work to make your 
decision.</em>          
           
           
         </p>
    <p><em>Hopefully this information has 
helped you and we hope that you <a
